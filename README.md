# SDP-project
DOTS simulation 

Requirements (TO BE DISCUSSED)
-Display on screen multiple “humans”
	Humans are represented with a 2d symbol (for example a colored dot)
	The color of the symbol changes with the “state” in which the human is
	The state could be “never infected”, “infected”-> (asymptomatic and then symptomatic), “healed” or”dead”
-Display a map -> autogenerated/fixed? Starting from a manually defined set of cells that are repeated randomly to form the map
	Places: Houses, offices, parks, supermarkets, pubs/restaurants
	Places are connected by streets
	Humans are spawned randomly, they have one home
-Humans movement based on different factors -> pathfinding:
	Needs: hunger -> supermarket, social interactions -> pub , sport -> park, work -> offices, fatigue -> home
-Contagion, probability based formula based on different factors (where to find it/how to generate the formula?):
	Distance
	Time
	Behavior
		Mask 
		social distancing (0-> collision, 1-> huge distance)
		infected social responsibility (quarantine respect)
	Health -> (“healed”/”dead”)/factor in contagion probability 
	Inside/outside -> how to find a formula?
-Display graphs on contagion status and stats
	Contagion vs time
